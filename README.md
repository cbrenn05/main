Hello, I'm a software engineering student at the University of Guelph. Thanks for stopping by!

The project I'm working on right now is a Spaced Repetition Flashcard app.
Spaced Repetition is a flashcard-based style of learning in which terms that are deemed
more "difficult" to remember are shown to the user more often than easier ones until
the user can remember them. The intervals at which terms are shown are determined
by their difficulty (ex. terms that have not been remembered are tested every day until 
performance improves; terms that are recalled easily are set to be tested again in 3 days,
then a week, then a month). Flashcard app Quizlet employs this kind of learning!
